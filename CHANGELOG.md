### 4.1.16: Unreleased

- autosubmit/autosubmit container now includes the `$USER` environment variable
  via its entrypoint #2359
- Adding a Slurm Container to the CI/CD and creating tests to increase the
  coverage of the Platforms #977
- Execute scripts to generate the documentation and standardize expid on documentation #1160

### 4.1.15: Bug fixes, enhancements, and new features

The filter `-fp` of the command `autosubmit stats` changed in this release.
Previously, a `-fp 0` would not raise any errors, and would bring all the
jobs, just like when no filter is provided. Now both negative numbers and
`0` (zero) raise an error, and only values greater than `0` are used to compute
the filter the jobs. Not using any value for `-fp` still returns all jobs.

**Bug fixes:**

- Corrected the logic for handling `ZombieProcess` errors in `psutil` calls done in `autosubmit stop`, which
  prevented the command from working correctly if the experiment process appeared after a zombie in the list #2394
- Fixed an issue with Autosubmit's CITATION.cff that prevented Zenodo from automatically
  adding new deposits via its webhook #2401
- Deleted command `autosubmit test` that was not working in Autosubmit 4 #2386
- Removed PBS and SGE platforms as they are not working in AS4 #2349
- Log levels in the command line now accept `ERROR` #2412
- Fix setstatus command to work in all cases #2381
- Fix PS platform to work with the local machine #2374

**Enhancements:**

- EDITO Autosubmit-Demo container updated to install API in different environment #2398
- Update portalocker requirement from <=3.1.1 to <=3.2.0 #2423
- Fixed a `ZeroDivisionError` when using RO-Crate or `stats`, and also an issue
  where the message said `None` could not be iterable. #2389
- Additional files are now generated upon using the `autosubmit inspect` command #2323'
